# credit-card-validator
Checks if the credit card is valid or not using Luhn's Algorithm.
Calculating the Luhn algorithm includes a few different steps. They are -

      1. Write down the credit card number
      2. Starting from the first number, double every other digit.
      3. If the result of the doubling ends up with a two digits, then add those two digits together.
      4. Add up all numbers.
      5. If the final sum is divisible by 10, then the credit card is valid. If it is not divisible by 10, the number is invalid or fake.
